# Compiler
Programmers write code in *source code*, but machines cannot read source code directly. There is a need to convert *source code* into *machine code*. Compiler is a software that can convert source code (programming language) into machine code (binary).

## Hello World
To create a new file, you can input "code <name>.c into the terminal"
 
```
  #include <stdio.h>
  
  int main(void)
  {
    printf("hello, world\n");
  }
```
The first line of the code tells the compiler that you'd like to use the library called *stdio.h*. This allows you to use the printf function.

The \n on the print line creates a new line after the command is run.
