### Binary
Binary is counting in the base of 2, where there is 2 possible output for each bit (0 and 1).\
0 is represented by 00\
1 is represented by 01\
2 is represented by 10\
As we use more bits, we can count higher numbers. For example, using 4 bits:\
4 is represented by 0100\
8 is represented by 1000\
15 is represented by 1111 (8+4+2+1)\
So for 4 bits of memory, we can represent up to 16 numbers (0-15). For 8 bits of memory, we can represent up to 256 numbers (0-255)

### Hexadecimal
We have 10 numbers that we can use (0-9). But what if we want to count higher than that. Using hexadecimal, we continue counting higher than 9 using the alphabet (A-F). Therefore, using 1 digit of hexadecimal, we can count up to 16 numbers (0-15).\
0 is represented by 0\
9 is represented by 9\
10 is represented by A\
15 is represented by F\
Using more digits, we can count up to 256 numbers (0-255).\
16 is represented by 10 (16x1 + 0)\
26 is represented by 1A\
31 is represented by 1F\
255 is represented by FF (16x15 + 1x15)\

We can see the correlation between binary and hexadecimal. 1 digit of hexadecimal takes 4 bits of memory, so 2 digits of hexadecimal can be represented using 1 byte (8 bits of memory).
