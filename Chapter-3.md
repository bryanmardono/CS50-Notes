### Running Time
Some common running times:
- $`O(n^2)`$: Order of n squared, where the time to solve will be squared as the size of problem increases
- $`O(n log n)`$
- $`O(n)`$: Order of n, where the time to solve will be linearly increase as the size of problem increases. In the worst case, it will take n step to solve the problem.
- $`O(log n)`$: Order of log n, where the time to solve will eventually plateau as the size of problem gets bigger
- $`O(1)`$: Order of 1, where the problem will be instantly solved in 1 step
Ω is used to denote the lower bound(best case) of an algorithm, such as Ω(log n)
Θ is used to denote when the upper and lower bound are the same, such as when counting the number of people in a room.
